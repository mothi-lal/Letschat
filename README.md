# Letschat 

**Letschat** is a simple real-time chatting app designed to help me learn full-stack development by building it hands-on.

## Creating client.py

Creating a chat server named client.py

Its main functons are :

Connects to the chat server (via IP + port).
Sends messages to the server.
Listens for messages from the server and prints them.
Keeps running until user quits.

dont run it still beacuse server.py has to br built

## Creating server.py

now creating a server which will 
Accept multiple clients
Receive messages from each client
Broadcast messages to all other clients
